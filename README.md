# MemoryDeck
This project is meant to display cards in a random order on screen, the user can then prompt the cards to be 
hidden but remain in the same order. The user is then to remember the correct order and recite the cards in 
order. If the user fails at reciting the correct card, the game is over. 

The underlying goal for this project is to strengthen memory by displaying an image that has a particular 
pattern and to have the subject remember these images in order. The subject is allowed to use any method 
of memorization, but the goal is to have progress to where the user can develop a strategy to which may
possibly be translatable to a different kind of image (trying to memorize numbers, or other patterns).
